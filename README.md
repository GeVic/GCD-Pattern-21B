# GCD-Pattern-21B
An Interesting GCD problem from Harvard Math 21B. If you wish to see the question then visit

(To inccrease the size of the image you could change the ```dim``` value in the ```gcd.py```)

So, In order to explain this pattern I plotted the GCD(x,y) with coressponding pixel densities.
And it could be seen that the line patterns are drawn as a result. 

Also, the line pattern could be matches the equartion ax = by. Which is very obvious as the 
Euclidean Algorithm for finding GCD(A,B) could be written as A = B.Q + R and if R = 0 then B = GCD(A,B).
And since A = B.Q + R represent line equation y = m.x + c, which in turn is y = mx if c = 0.

Thus, the lines in the above depiction corresponds to ax = by for intergral(a,b) and hence explains the line pattern.

Depiction of ax = by with coressponding intensities to be added soon....

## Why I did this?
The problem seems intresting. But still I think my explanation lacks something. It would be great if you wanna discuss 
the same.

## How should can edit the README file for better explanation?
Simple, create a pull request and I would be happy to hear you explanation.
